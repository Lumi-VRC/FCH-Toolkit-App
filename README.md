2. Run the provided .exe to start the program! I suggest pinning it to your taskbar.

## Instructions:
[Mostly self explanatory. Full instructions coming when tool is in a more complete state.]


### Security Disclaimer:
You are always welcome to throw any part of my code or the .exe directly into VirusTotal.
It will occasionally flag - but if you click into the flags, they will display this:

I am not paying $300-$1000 a year and creating a licensed company in order to  make VirusTotal happy.
This is essentially an expensive pinky promise that my code is not malware.
My code is open source. ChatGPT is free, if you need it. That's promise enough, in my eyes.


### Self-Compile:
If you're still unsure, or you're extra safety-minded:
Just download the entire project
There are some included .bat files to help you compile it yourself if you need to, once you install the dependencies.
Simply install the dependencies, and run the 'dev' .bat file in the program's root to try the program out.
Or:
Run 'npm run tauri dev' in order to build a test version and run the program.
Run 'npm run tauri build' in order to build an .exe and .msi installer.
